# Resume

My **[resume.json](resume.json)** is created using the open source initiative of a [JSON-based standard for resumes](https://jsonresume.org/).  

The JSON file is based on the schema https://jsonresume.org/schema/

The latest version of the résumé is always available at https://registry.jsonresume.org/jctim.
